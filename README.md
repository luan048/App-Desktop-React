## 3 How the project works?
The project is still simple, the main objective was to transform a simple form into an attractive .exe format for the desktop, </br>
its only functionality, made in JavaScript, was to make the password field visible, and send a success message, </br> 
if both fields are filled out. I added the form twice, because I wanted to leave it with the overflow functionality.
